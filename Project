To be honest, i did not completly 
program this website. I used very much Youtube's tutorials,
mainly from the user "NetNinja". Besides big part of Youtube's help i feel pretty pround of my work anyway. It was the first,
big project to complete using new to me programming languages like python,javascript and Django Framework(which has
a secret place in my heart, because of this framework i was able to finish my project) :D
